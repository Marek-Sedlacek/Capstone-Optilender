          <p align="justify">Our goal for the OptiLender strategy is to outperform the returns produced by investing
            using Prosper’s rating grade alone. Given a risk tolerance level in the form of a Prosper rating grade distribution,
            our model should be able to recommend a pool of loans with comparable or lower risk that produces higher returns.
            This is not to say we expect to outperform Prosper’s underlying pricing model.
            Instead, we want to identify high return pockets within the general pool and make them visible to investors.
          </p>

          <br>
          <br>

          <p align="justify"> Our model uses a decision tree regressor algorithm to predict expected return.
            This approach allows us to model a continuous variable, while maintaining the explainability of a tree.
            The decision tree structure also classifies each loan in the portfolio into a end node, which is conducive
            to our end goal of dividing the portfolio into high-performance and low-performance pools. The model considers
            the borrower's rating grade, number of credit inquiries, monthly payments on outstanding debts, and seven other
            customer attributes. The model is in fact a combination of six separate models: one tree built for each year
            of originations since 2010. Each is calibrated only with the performance of accounts older than 12 months at
            the beginning of the vintage to prevent retrospective prediction. As new data arrives, we will continue
            the annual recalibration process.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <p align="justify"> We estimate the expected risk of each pool by randomly sampling 100 portfolios
            of loans from each pool, and calculate the standard deviation of the returns on these portfolios.
            The number of loans in a portfolio will depend on the investor's available capital. The model will then
            recommend pools of loans whose expected risk is smaller and expected return is greater than those produced
            by the rating grade distribution alone.
